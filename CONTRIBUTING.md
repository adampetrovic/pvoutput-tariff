## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- pipenv (for dependency management)
- Docker (optional, for container testing)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pvoutput-tariff.git
   cd pvoutput-tariff
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/adampetrovic/pvoutput-tariff.git
   ```

4. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

5. **Verify the setup:**
   ```bash
   make check
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a simplified Git flow:

- `main` - Stable release branch
- `develop/*` - Development branches for upcoming releases
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `fix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes for production

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Keeping Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on the latest main
git rebase upstream/main

# Force push if needed (be careful with shared branches)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some modifications enforced by our tools:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **String quotes**: Double quotes preferred
- **Import sorting**: Use isort with Black profile
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions and methods

### Code Quality Tools

Run these commands to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Check formatting
make format-check

# Lint code
make lint

# Type checking
make type-check

# Security scanning
make security

# Run all checks
make check
```

### Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `style`: Code style changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: add support for dynamic tariff pricing
fix: handle timezone conversion edge cases
docs: update configuration examples
test: add tests for seasonal tariff calculation
```

### Code Structure

```python
# Example function with proper documentation and type hints
def calculate_current_tariff(
    tariff_config: Dict[str, Any],
    current_time: datetime,
    public_holidays: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> float:
    """Calculate the current tariff rate based on time and configuration.
    
    Args:
        tariff_config: Dictionary containing tariff configuration
        current_time: Current datetime for tariff calculation
        public_holidays: Optional public holiday configuration
        
    Returns:
        Current tariff rate in cents per kWh
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If tariff configuration is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- Tests are located in the `test/` directory
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Writing Tests

```python
import unittest
from datetime import datetime

class TestTariffCalculation(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test fixtures before each test method."""
        self.sample_config = {
            "peak": {"price": 45.87, "times": [{"start": "14:00", "end": "20:00"}]},
            "offpeak": {"price": 25.43, "times": []}
        }

    def test_peak_time_calculation(self):
        """Test that peak rates are correctly applied during peak hours."""
        test_time = datetime(2024, 6, 15, 15, 30)  # 3:30 PM
        result = get_current_tariff(self.sample_config, {}, test_time)
        self.assertEqual(result, 45.87)

    def test_offpeak_fallback(self):
        """Test that off-peak rates are used when no other tariff matches."""
        test_time = datetime(2024, 6, 15, 10, 30)  # 10:30 AM
        result = get_current_tariff(self.sample_config, {}, test_time)
        self.assertEqual(result, 25.43)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test file
pipenv run pytest test/test_tariffs.py

# Run with verbose output
make test-verbose

# Run only failed tests
make test-failed
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >90% test coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Use `make test-cov` to generate coverage reports
